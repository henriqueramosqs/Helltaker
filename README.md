# Helltaker
 This is an adaptation of the puzzle game Helltaker. For the plot, the hero, who has just died, is offered an apportunity to come back to life if he convinces
 some demons to do not quit their jobs in hell. For each level, one can walk around and interact with obstacles, key-door systems, spikes and enemies until reaching the demon who has to be convinced.
 It`s worth saying that each of those demons have strong and distinct personalities, which must be taken in consideration when picking answerns during conversations with them.

To play it, use 'W','A','S' and 'D' keys to move and 'Enter' to confirm an action. Walking towards an obstacle or an enemy implies in a kick from the hero.

## Intalation and Running
To play this game, one should clone this repository and use a RISC-V simulator to run 'main.s' archive. Some options like the <a href="https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS">FPGRARS</a> are viable, but
we strongly recommend the RARS app that will be dowloaded with the code. If that’s the case, don’t forget to click on ‘tools’ and connect both the Keyboard MMIO and the Bitmap Display to the program.
